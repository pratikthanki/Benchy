# Benchy

My attempt/ work-in-progress in creating a load testing tool inspired 
by [k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6)

Getting started with benchy is pretty straightforward, defined a set of `Stages` 
followed by a list of urls and even a `useragent`. At present this will work with 
public web services. See [Configuration.cs](./Benchy/Configuration.cs) for full 
details.
